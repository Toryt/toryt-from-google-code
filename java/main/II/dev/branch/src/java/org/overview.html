<p>The final goal of Toryt is to run a {@link org.toryt_II.Test}. A {@link
  org.toryt_II.Test Tests} can be compound or simple. Toryts main feature
  are {@link org.toryt_II.ContractTest ContractTests}, which separate the
  test description from the test execution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contracts are a test factory AND a declarative description of the contract
  of units.</p>
<h1>Tests</h1>
<p>isolated; </p>
<p>term: atomic</p>
<p>In Toryt, it is important that {@link org.toryt_II.Test Test} instances
  are normally generated on-demand by an instance of {@link org.toryt_II.TestFactory
  TestFactory}. </p>
<h1>Turning Contracts and Cases into Tests</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The contract of a <dfn>project</dfn> is the union of the contracts
    of all <strong>packages</strong> in the project.</li>
  <li>The contract of a <dfn>package</dfn> is the union of the contracts
    of all <strong>classes</strong> in the package and the contracts of
    all <strong>subpackages</strong>.</li>
  <li>The contract of a class is the collection of the <strong>type invariants</strong> of
    the class and all its supertypes, and the union of the contracts of
    all <strong>constructors</strong>, <strong>mutators</strong> and <strong>non-basic
    inspectors</strong> of the class (instance <em>and</em> class mutators
    and non-basic inspectors).</li>
  <li>The contract of a method is the aggregate of the methods <strong>preconditions</strong>,
    <strong>postconditions</strong> and <strong>exception-conditions</strong> of
    the method and all its super-specifications, plus the type invariants
    of the class the method is implemented in and all its supertypes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing a <dfn>project</dfn> means testing all of its <strong>packages</strong>,
  and possibly more. Testing a <dfn>package</dfn> means testing all of
  its <strong>classes</strong> and all of its <strong>subpackages</strong>,
  and possibly more. Testing a <dfn>class</dfn> means testing all of its <strong>constructors</strong>, <strong>mutators</strong> and <strong>non-basic
  inspectors</strong>, and possibly more. Testing a <dfn>method</dfn> means
  calling the method in a number of relevant <strong>cases</strong> that
  are allowed by the <dfn>preconditions</dfn>, and veryfing that the <dfn>postconditions</dfn> are
  met afterwards, or, alternatively, if an exception occurs, that it fullfils
  the appropriate <dfn>exception-conditions</dfn>, and possibly more. Verifying
  a method's contract in a particular case we call a <dfn>case contract
  method test</dfn> ({@link org.toryt_II.CaseContractMethodTest}).<br />
  So, testing a <dfn>project</dfn> means <strong>testing all of the methods
  in the project</strong> (that are not basic inspectors) <strong>with
  appropriate cases</strong>, and possibly more at the level of the project,
  its packages, classes or methods. It is important to see that, from a
  contract point-of-view, and apart from the &quot;possibly more&quot;,
  there is no such thing as a project test, a package test, a class test
  or a bare method test. From a contract point-of-view, there are only <dfn>tests
  of methods applied to a cases</dfn>. On all higher levels, there are
  only <dfn>collections </dfn>of <dfn>case contract method tests</dfn>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <dfn>project test collection</dfn> gathers <dfn>case contract method
      tests</dfn> for all methods in the project with appropriate cases,
      and possibly some more tests on the level of the project, its packages,
      classes or methods.<br />
    A <dfn>contract project test collection</dfn> ({@link org.toryt_II.ContractProjectTestList})
    gathers case contract method tests for all methods in the project with
    appropriate cases.</li>
  <li>A <dfn>package test collection</dfn> gathers <dfn>case contract
      method tests</dfn> for all methods in the package with appropriate
      cases, and possibly some more tests on the level of the package,
      its subpackages, classes or methods.<br />
    A <dfn>contract package test collection</dfn> ({@link org.toryt_II.ContractPackageTestList})
    gathers <dfn>case contract method tests</dfn> for all methods in the
    package with appropriate cases.</li>
  <li>A <dfn>class test collection </dfn>gathers <dfn>case contract method
      tests</dfn> for all methods in the class with appropriate cases,
      and possibly some more tests on the level of the class or its methods.<br />
    A contract class test collection ({@link org.toryt_II.ContractClassTestList})
    gathers <dfn>case contract method tests</dfn> for all method in the
    class with appropriate cases.</li>
  <li>A <dfn>method test collection</dfn> gathers <dfn>case contract method
      tests</dfn> for the method for appropriate cases, and possibly some
      more tests on the level of the method.<br />
    A <dfn>contract method test collection</dfn> ({@link org.toryt_II.ContractMethodTestList})
    gathers <dfn>case contract method tests</dfn> for the method for appropriate
    cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <dfn>case contract method test</dfn> is the combination of the <dfn>contract</dfn> of
  the method with a <dfn>test case</dfn>.<br />
  A <dfn>method test factory</dfn> will combine the <dfn>test cases</dfn> of
  a method with the <dfn>contract </dfn>of the method to generate a number
  of <dfn>contract method tests</dfn>., and possibly will generate some
  more method tests.</p>
