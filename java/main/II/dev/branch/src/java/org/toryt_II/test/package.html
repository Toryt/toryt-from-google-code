    <p>Actual tests to be run. This package defined the interface
      for tests, and an abstract implementation of as much as possible.</p>

    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>The only actual kind of tests that are available now
      are contract based method tests. The implementation
      of these tests are placed in a separate package,
      <code>org.toryt_II.contracttest</code>, to avoid for
      this general package to depend on contracts.</p>
    <p>We would expect to have general code, for method
      tests and other kinds of tests here. At this time,
      however, we have no clear idea how that would work.</p>
    <p><strong>Developers should contact the author to
      add and refactor code here if they implement other
      kinds of tests.</strong></p>
